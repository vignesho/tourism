# Kerala-Tourism-Website
HelloðŸ‘‹

This is a small website that I built using Bootstrap and other basic components as part of my web development studies. Basically, this website provides information about different tourist places in Kerala and The user has the option to log in or sign up to their private accounts(no backend, just UI).
This work gave me very good exposure to the whole bootstrap framework and Web UI designing.
